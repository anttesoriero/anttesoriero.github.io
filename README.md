# Anthony Tesoriero Personal Website - [AntTes.com](http://anttes.com)

This is my personal website that I am testing on GitHub servers. 
Previously, I used CPanel hosting with Godaddy, since it has php support. 
I've decided to try to switch over to GitHub though, since it's free! I am currently a Computer Science student at Rowan University, 
and I feel it is important for all students to have a personal website. 

If you would like to host your own website on GitHub, you can find out how to do so 
[here](https://gist.github.com/TylerFisher/6127328), or by looking it up online.

## Updates
### Issues ### 
###### 10 February 2020
Almost everything has merged over properly, with bascially no issues. I was able to switch the navigation bar from php to javascript, so now I can still just update one file to change the nav bar on all pages. The only issue I'm really having is CSS showing. For some reason, I cannot get the site to show any CSS. Online, some people are syaing css and images can't be in folders, but my images folder works just fine, and same with other css files. The only one not working is my main.css. Hopefully I can fix this issue soon, and then I can cancel my GoDaddy hosting. 

### Big Changes ### 
###### 28 October 2019
As of today, this site is undergoing a major overhaul on GitHub. 
The old GitHub site looked like [this](https://git.anttes.com/OldSite/).
The change is going to make the site look more like my [main site](http://anttes.com), currently using php.
I will be testing a full html version [here](http://anttes.com/GitSite).
