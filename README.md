# Anthony Tesoriero Personal Website - [AntTes.com](http://anttes.com)

This is my personal website that I am testing on GitHub servers. 
Previously, I used CPanel hosting with Godaddy, since it has php support. 
I've decided to try to switch over to GitHub though, since it's free! I am currently a Computer Science student at Rowan University, 
and I feel it is important for all students to have a personal website. 

If you would like to host your own website on GitHub, you can find out how to do so 
[here](https://gist.github.com/TylerFisher/6127328), or by looking it up online.

## Updates
### Big Changes ### 
###### 28 October 2019
As of today, this site is undergoing a major overhaul on GitHub. 
The old GitHub site looked like [this](https://git.anttes.com/OldSite/).
The change is going to make the site look more like my [main site](http://anttes.com), currently using php.
I will be testing a full html version [here](http://anttes.com/GitSite).
