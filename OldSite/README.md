# Anthony Tesoriero Personal Website - [AntTes.com](http://anttes.com)

## About
This is my personal website, that I am testing on GitHub servers. 
Previously, I used CPanel hosting with Godaddy, since it has php support. I've decided to try to switch over to GitHub though, since it's free!

## Updates
### Big Changes ### 
###### 28 October 2019
As of today, this site is undergoing a major overhaul on GitHub. 
The current GitHub site looks like [this](http://git.anttes.com) (this link will be changed when the old/current GitHub site look moves).
The change is going to make the site look more like my [main site](http://anttes.com), currently using php.
I will be testing a full html version [here](http://anttes.com/GitSite).
