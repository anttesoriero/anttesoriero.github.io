            <h2>Hi, I'm Anthony. Welcome to Ehg, or I guess Ehg Things.</h2>
            <h3 style="font-weight: 400;">
                If you're here, you may be wondering what those Ehg Things are, and why they're so beautiful. Well, I'm here to answer those questions! 
                All those little guys are what I call Ehg's. They're those big headed things that are fun to draw. </h3>
            <h3 style="font-weight: 400;">
                Sometimes, I also draw animal-like Ehg's, such has HorseDog. You'll also randomly see other drawing that may pop up from time to time. 
                They'll probably still be a similar style to my Ehg's, but look a little different (hence the "Things").
            </h3>
            <h2>What do you use to draw your amazing things?</h2>
            <h3 style="font-weight: 400;">
                I'm glad you ask loyal reader. I currently use a 2018 12.9" iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil. I mostly use procreate for the main Ehg's, but will also use other apps like notability sometimes.
                It all depends on what I'm doing at the time and what style I feel like doing.
            </h3>
            <h2>Where can I see more of these beauties?</h2>
            <h3 style="font-weight: 400;">
                You can probably see some more on my Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ehgthings/" target="_blank">@EhgThings</a>). I don't know what will be updated more yet, 
                or how often I'll draw something, but I guess we'll see.
            </h3>
            <h2>What are doodles?</h2>
            <h3 style="font-weight: 400;">
                What a great question! Ehg Things Doodles are just what they sound like, doodles! Before when I talked about random drawings, those would be doodles.
                They don't always fit the theme of Ehg's, but they're still my drawing style, so I include them here. You can find more doodles <a href="ehgThingsDoodles">here</a>,
                or by clicking the "Doodles" link in the Ehg menu.
            </h3>

                Here's a doodle Ladybug just for the about page<img src="ehg/LadybugNoBack.png" alt="LadybugNoBack" height="auto" width="200px">
            </h3>
            <h2>Have any requests or ideas?</h2>
            <h3 style="font-weight: 400;">
                If you have a request or idea, I'd love to hear it! Head over to the <a href="http://anttes.com/contact/">AntTes Contact Page</a> to send me a message.
                At the beginning of your comment, put something like "Ehg" or "Ehg Things", this way I know what you're talking about.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-weight: 400;">
                I don't know if there's anything else to say, so I guess that's it for the about page. If you have any other questions you can message me about that too.
                Maybe I'll add something here too if it's iteresting enough. Other than that, I hope whoever is actually looking at this enjoy's some Ehg Things.
